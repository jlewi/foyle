	// This is done by calling the Route() function,  which tells go-app what
	// component to display for a given path, on both client and server-side.
	app.Route("/", &hello{})

	// Once the routes set up, the next thing to do is to either launch the app
	// or the server that serves the app.
	//
	// When executed on the client-side, the RunWhenOnBrowser() function
	// launches the app,  starting a loop that listens for app events and
	// executes client instructions. Since it is a blocking call, the code below
	// it will never be executed.
	//
	// When executed on the server-side, RunWhenOnBrowser() does nothing, which
	// lets room for server implementation without the need for precompiling
	// instructions.
	app.RunWhenOnBrowser()

	// Finally, launching the server that serves the app is done by using the Go
	// standard HTTP package.
	//
	// The Handler is an HTTP handler that serves the client and all its
	// required resources to make it work into a web browser. Here it is
	// configured to handle requests with a path that starts with "/".
