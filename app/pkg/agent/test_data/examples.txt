Continue writing the markdown document by adding a code block with the commands a user should execute.
Follow these rules

* Set the language inside the code block to bash
* Use the text at the end of the document to determine what commands to execute next
* Use the existing text and code blocks in the document to learn phrases that are predictive of specific commands
* Only respond with a single code block
* You can put multiple commands into a code block
* If the text at the end of the document doesn't clearly describe a command to execute simply respond with the </output> tag
