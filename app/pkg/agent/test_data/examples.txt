Please continue writing this markdown document to deal with any tasks or issues listed
in the document. The document is a markdown document. It will contain a description of the task
or problem, I need your help with. It will then contain one or more code blocks containing commands
to be executed to accomplish the task or obtain information needed to figure out the problem.
If a command has already been executed the output of the command will be provided in a code block
with the language `output`. Use the output to help you figure out the problem or complete the task.
If you need me to execute a command please provide the command in a code block and I will execute it
and then add the output to the document.

Here are a bunch of examples of input documents along with the expected output. You can use these examples to help you figure out the problem or task to be solved.
