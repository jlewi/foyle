To get started, I create a Markdown cell,
and I start typing my question, which in

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.920
this case is, how much does Foyle cost?

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.030
We're going to filter it out to only show
rows where total input tokens is greater

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.960
than zero and you can see that as I'm
typing Foyle is in the background coming

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.879
up with suggestions for the commands that
I can run to achieve that intent and in

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:29.529
this case those commands get rendered as
a ghost cell which is those lightly grayed

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:34.270
out text . I can select that cell and
then I can execute it to see the results.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.949
And so in this case we get back
the query results which tell

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.450
us how much we're spending on
input tokens and output tokens.
