  <!-- I believe captions should be embedded in the mp4 but they don't seem to show up. My solution
    was to export a vtt file from deskrypt and host it on the site. 
    Subtitles are served out of hugo/netlify and not Cloud Storage because the request to fetch the vtt
    out of cloud storage gets blocked by browser security settings.
