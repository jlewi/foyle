## Markdown Support

Foyle supports markdown files. Using Foyle you can

* Open existing markdown files in the VSCode Notebook Editor
* Automatically render and execute code blocks as code cells in your notebook
* Save your notebook as a markdown file

To use markdown files in Foyle just give your file an extension of `.md` or `.markdown`. When you open the file in Foyle
it will be automatically rendered as a notebook.

**Important** When persisting notebooks as markdown cell outputs are currently not saved. This feature may be added
in the future.

## When to use Markdown Files

Markdown files are useful when you are working in a shared code repository that is already using markdown files
for documentation and playbooks.
