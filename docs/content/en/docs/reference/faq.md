## Why not use the Jupyter Kernel?

The Jupyter kernel creates a dependency on the python tool chain. If you aren't already using Python this can be a hassle. Requiring a python environment is an unnecessary dependency if all we want to do is create a simple server to execute shell commands.

If users want to execute python code they can still do it by invoking `python` in the cell.
