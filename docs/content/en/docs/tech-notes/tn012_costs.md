## Objective

* Understand Why Foyle Costs So Much

## TL;DR

Since enabling Ghost Cells, Foyle has been using a lot of tokens. 

We need to understand why and see if we can reduce the cost without significantly impacting quality. In particular,
there are two different drivers of our input tokens

* How many completions we generate for a particular context (e.g. as a user types)
* How much context we include in each completion
